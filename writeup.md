# Learnings while attempting box-model projects

I used box-shadow to build a solid border and that was a new thing. Around 5 of us had a 3-4 hour long night online session in which we completed a lot of projects and solved each others' layout issues. This was brilliant. Just looking at other people's code and trying to figure things out is beautiful.

I came to know about vercel. I'll try and use it ASAP. These assignments have reaffirmed the value of the dev tools. A couple of times I could see the speed gains while trying to debug. I might try and use them more now.

On the second day, there was much work to do in the last two projects. The detailing needed is increasing everyday and this is encouraging. I especially liked the 6th project where we had to create multiple borders around a square and align a few rectangles. I made mistakes along the way with different approaches like I tried using pseudo-elements and it didn't work for me at all. Then I thought of creating multiple divs and then position them on top of one another with z-indexes. Finally, I settled down on using border, box-shadow and outline as proxy-borders.

I'll try and see why pseudo-elements are not working for me.
