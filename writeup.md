# Learnings while attempting box-model projects

I used box-shadow to build a solid border and that was a new thing. Around 5 of us had a 3-4 hour long night online session in which we completed a lot of projects and solved each others' layout issues. This was brilliant. Just looking at other people's code and trying to figure things out is beautiful.

I came to know about vercel. I'll try and use it ASAP. These assignments have reaffirmed the value of the dev tools. A couple of times I could see the speed gains while trying to debug. I might try and use them more now.
